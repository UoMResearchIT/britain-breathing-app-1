  <h4 padding>Title of the research.</h4>
  <p padding>
    #BritainBreathing: Using citizen science to map the incidence of seasonal allergy symptoms
  </p>

  <h4 padding>Why have I been chosen?</h4>
  <p padding>
    I am inviting anyone who is computer literate to download the app and complete the online
    questionnaire if they want to. Under 16s should obtain permission from a parent/guardian.
  </p>

  <h4 padding>What would I be asked to do if I take part?</h4>
  <p padding>
    You will first need to download the free #BritainBreathing app to your phone. Currently the app is
    only available on the Android operating system but we hope to expand to iOS soon. Your phone
    will also ask if you want location tracking enabled – please allow this. It means that we can match
    your symptoms to what conditions are like in the area you are (e.g. weather, pollen levels,
    pollution levels).
  </p>
  <p padding>
    Once downloaded, you will need to fill out a short questionnaire giving basic details about you
    (year of birth, gender and allergy type).
  </p>
  <p padding>
    You can then start entering data on the app. You will asked to record how your allergy
    symptoms are currently affecting your eyes, nose, breathing and tiredness. The app has been designed to
    be as simple as possible to use. Entering the data should take less than one minute to complete
    each time you do it. For best results, we recommend that you aim to enter data at least daily.
    However, you can enter data as often, or as little, as you like. Once you start entering data, you
    will be able to view a series of graphs to see how your symptoms change over time.
  </p>

  <h4 padding>What happens to the data collected?</h4>
  <p padding>
    By downloading and using the app, you agree to share your data with researchers as part of the
    #BritainBreathing research project. Only anonymous data will be collected and the data will never
    be linked back to you. All electronic data are stored securely at The University of Manchester and
    are accessible only to researchers.
  </p>

  <h4 padding>How is confidentiality maintained?</h4>
  <p padding>
    Only anonymous data will be collected and the data will never be linked back to you. We do not
    ask for names and/or any other information that may identify individuals. Furthermore, we will only
    use your approximate location at postcode district level (i.e. the first part e.g. M14) with the level
    of detail limited to 500 metres for mapping and analysis purposes. Therefore no one will be able
    to recognize who the data belongs to.
  </p>

  <p padding>
  From 25 May 2018 the University of Manchester are collecting and storing this information in accordance
  with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 which legislate to protect
  your personal information.  The legal basis upon which we are using your personal information is
  “public interest task” and “for research purposes” if sensitive information is collected.

  <h4 padding>Will I be paid for participating in the research?</h4>
  <p padding>
    You will not be paid for participating in this research.
  </p>

  <h4 padding>What is the duration of the research?</h4>
  <p padding>
    The questionnaire will take less than one minute to complete each time you use the app.
    Where will the research be conducted?
  </p>
  <p padding>
    You can complete the online questionnaire via teh app at any time or place you like. Data
    analysis will be conducted at The University of Manchester.
  </p>

  <h4 padding>What if I change my mind?</h4>
  <p padding>
    It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you can
    download the app and begin to enter data. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw
    at any time without giving a reason and without detriment to yourself.
  </p>

  <h4 padding>Will the outcomes of the research be published?</h4>
  <p padding>
    On the project website, we soon hope to launch a national map where you can see how people
    around the UK are experiencing allergy symptoms on any given day.
    The outcomes of the research will be published in technical reports and/or conference/journal
    papers. If you visit the website http://www.britainbreathing.org/ and provide your email address to
    receive updates, we will send you regular emails about progress with the project, including any
    reports or publications we produce about scientific findings.
