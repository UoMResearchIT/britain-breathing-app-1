  <h4 padding>Participant Information</h4>

  <p padding>
    You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is 
    being conducted and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Please ask 
    if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. Thank you for taking 
    the time to read this. 
  </p>

  
  <h4 padding>Title of the research.</h4>
  <p padding>
    #BritainBreathing: Using citizen science to map the incidence of seasonal allergy symptoms
  </p>

  <h4 padding>Who will conduct the research?</h4>
  <p padding>
    The #BritainBreathing Team, who are Dr Markel Vigo*, Dr Caroline Jay, Dr Sheena Cruickshank,
    Dr Lamiece Hassan and Prof Andy Brass (all at The University of Manchester).
    The data collected will feed into a larger, international collaboration looking at the 
    relationship between air quality and allergy/respiratory health, conducted in association 
    with the Britain Breathing team, and the Alan Turing Institute.
  </p>

  <h4 padding> What is the purpose of the research?</h4>
  <p padding>

    We are interested in collecting data from individuals who suffer from allergy and/or respiratory problems, 
    with the aim of gaining a population level understanding of the environmental factors that affect people’s 
    symptoms for better or worse. 

  </p>

  <h4 padding>Why have I been chosen?</h4>
  <p padding>
    I am inviting anyone who is computer literate to download the app and complete the online
    questionnaire if they want to. Under 16s should obtain permission from a parent/guardian.
  </p>

  <h4 padding>What would I be asked to do if I take part?</h4>
  <p padding>
    You will first need to download the free Britain Breathing app onto your phone. 
    Your phone will also ask if you want location tracking enabled – please allow this. 
    It means that we can match your symptoms to what conditions are like in the area you are 
    (e.g. weather, pollen and pollution levels). Once you have downloaded the app, you will 
    need to fill out a short questionnaire giving basic details about you (year of birth, 
    sex assigned at birth and allergy type or respiratory condition). You can then start 
    entering data on the app. You will be asked to record how your allergy symptoms are 
    currently affecting your eyes, nose, breathing and tiredness. The app has been designed 
    to be as simple as possible to use. Entering the data should take less than one minute to c
    omplete each time you do it. For best results, we recommend that you aim to enter data at 
    least daily. However, you can enter data as little or as often as you like. Once you start 
    entering data, you will be able to view a series of graphs to see how your symptoms are changing over time.
  </p>


  <h4 padding>What will happen to my personal information?</h4>
  <p padding>
    By downloading and using the app, you agree to share your data with researchers as part of the Britain Breathing research project. 
    Only anonymous data will be collected and the data will never be linked back to you. All electronic data are stored securely at 
    The University of Manchester and are accessible only to researchers. In order to ensure our research is reproducible, we may make 
    curated versions of the dataset (parts of the data we have used for running experiments and which underpin academic papers) openly 
    available. This means that other researchers and the general public can scrutinize our results, and use the data for their own research. 
    This data will be completely anonymised, and it will not be possible to identify individuals from the data. We will log your location 
    when you submit symptom data so we can match symptoms to environmental conditions, including pollution, pollen and weather data. W
    e will not publish specific locations (and instead use summary data at the level of the postcode), and we will not link your name with this data.
  </p>

  <p padding> 
    We are collecting and storing this personal information in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 
    which legislate to protect your personal information.  The legal basis upon which we are using your personal information is “public interest task” and 
    “for research purposes” if sensitive information is collected. For more information about the way we process your personal information and comply with 
    data protection law please see our <a href="http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=37095">Privacy Notice for Research Participants.</a>

  <p padding> 
    The University of Manchester, as Data Controller for this project, takes responsibility for the protection of the personal information 
    that this study is collecting about you. In order to comply with the legal obligations to protect your personal data the University has

    following way: Only anonymous data will be collected and the data will never be linked back to you. We do not ask for names and/or any other 
    information that may identify individuals.

  <h4 padding>Will my participation in the study be confidential? </h4>
  <p padding>
      Your participation in the study will be kept confidential to the study team and those with access to your personal information as 
      listed above. Your data is assigned a participant ID only known to research team (also referred to pseudonymised or coded data) 
      ensuring the reporting of the data is done in such a way that individuals cannot be readily identified.  
  </p>


  <h4 padding>What happens if I do not want to take part or if I change my mind?</h4>
  <p padding>
      It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be able to refer to this information in the app at any time. 
      You will be asked to give your consent by agreeing to the terms and conditions presented here by selecting the “I agree to the terms and conditions” checkbox.  
      If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without detriment to yourself. However, it will not be possible to 
      remove your data from the project once it has been anonymised and forms part of the dataset as we will not be able to identify your specific data. 
      This does not affect your data protection rights. 
  </p>

  <h4 padding>Will my data be used for future research?</h4>
  <p padding>
      When you agree to take part in a research study, the information about your health and care may be provided to researchers running other research studies in 
      this organisation. The future research should not be incompatible with this research project and will concern allergy/respiratory and environmental research fields.  
      These organisations may be universities, SUS organisations or companies involved in health and care research in Brazil. Aggregated anonymous data will be freely 
      available and shared openly for other research purposes via a repository that allows global public access to the data in this form.
  </p>  
      
  <p padding>
      This information will not identify you and will not be combined with other information in a way that could identify you. 
      The information will only be used for the purpose of research, and cannot be used to contact you regarding any other matter or to affect your care. 
      It will not be used to make decisions about future services available to you.
